# DESCRIPTION OF THE SOLUTION
# Dataset description
Our dataset comes from plantvillage which is a research and development unit of Penn State University. This dataset consists of 14530 images of tomato leaves divided into ten classes including nine classes of leaves with different diseases and one class of healthy leaves.
# Methodology
In order to have an optimal result at the end of the project, we decided to use two approaches, one based on transfer learning and the other based on a sequential model developed by ourselves. For the transfer learning-based approach, we decided to use the pre-trained InceptionV3 model.
InceptionV3 is an extended network from the popular GoogLeNet that has achieved good classification performance in several biomedical applications using transfer learning.
